The short summary Wackydatabase or Wackydb allows you do almost anything with items/pieces/recipes without coding. </br>
From cloning to color changes, set effects and even something as simple as language translating, as well as so much more. <br />


Features:
- WackysDatabase is a mod for Valheim it requires BepInEx for Valheim.
- With this mod you are able to control all items/recipes/pieces/effects via YML files.
- WackysDatabase also allows you to make clone/mock of these objects as well. 
- This mod is one of the last to load in the game. 
- As such it can touch almost all normal and modded objects.
- Can color items or changes icons of items/pieces/set effects

- You can create new items with this mod and make them exclusive. 


<details><summary> General Knowledge </summary>

    There are three (4) Objects that WackyDB touches. Items, Recipes, Pieces, Item Effects

    Items are things in your inventory, you can pickup and maybe equip them. 

    Recipes are used to construct items, CraftingStations can be workbench, forge, or hand crafted (craftingStation": "")

    Pieces are what you use in your hammer and hoe to construct or plant. (Piecehammers)

    Item Effects - Can be set Effects or Indiviudal effects - IE burning or frost, or an armor set effect

</details> 

<details><summary> Installation</summary>

Download and extract the latest version of WackysDatabase into the BepInEx plugin folder (usually Valheim/BepInEx/plugins )

Now run Valheim and join a world. After that go to Valheim/BepInEx/config/. There should be a folder called wackysDatabase,</br>
inside of that folder are currently three folders /Items/  /Recipes/ and /Pieces/

Put the mod on the Server to force Server Sync. The YML files only have to be on the Server. No need to share the YML. 

For Multiplayer, the mod has been locked down to prevent easy cheating, but I recommend https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/AzuAntiCheat/ and https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/ServerCharacters/ as well.

        Version 1.4.2
            Had to disable Piece snapshot because of hovering pieces stacking up on each other, hopefully someone fixes it someday.
            You might have to destroy the existing pieces at (0,0) with infinity hammer quite a lot depending on reloads and players joining.    
        Version 1.4.1
            Some items don't like snapshot icons - Added extra checks and only items with material changes get new icons
        Version 1.4.0
            Added DedServer load Memory config to allow people to see if loading Wackydb on DedServer helps or hinders. 
            extraSecurity - Allows people who don't want the extra cheat protection to disable it and not get 0.0.1 Error
            Big News! Added auto Icon Generation to cloned Items, and all Pieces with custom material(pieces angles are a little wonky or wacky if you will) - Thx Blaxx for code
        Version 1.3.6
            Added m_attackHealthPercentage and m_secAttackHealthPercentage- Warning any Items that uses this Must be recreated. s
            Otherwise default will go to 0. These items include the staffs that use a percentage of player health to power. 
        Version 1.3.5
            I have decided to add more parameters to Json file, so please do not use older version of Wackydb after upgrading. Wackydb 2.0 is not coming soon
            Existing Jsons are fine to use, you can regenerate them to get new values. 
            Added m_EitrCost, m_secEitrCost - These are attack costs for primary and secondary weapon attacks, no Eitr, no swing. 
            m_FoodEitr - Food Eitr amount, m_EitrRegen- Modifier to Eitr Regen - Very powerful on clothes, weapons, added more warnings. 
            Seperated out m_attackStamina and secondary m_attackStamina
        Version 1.3.2
            Mistlands Update: Removed extra Wet effect/restance since Mistlands adds its own. 
            Removed FoodColor, as it was removed from game and didn't really do anything.

            Known issue of TrophyDraugr is not able to be set (targets TrophyDraugrFem) use Fem or clone TrophyDraugr. 
            Destroyer is spelled with "troy", also now a loginfo instead of warning
        Version 1.2.5
            Moved wackysDatabase to Config instead of Plugins folder to stop r2mod from deleting folder on updates.
            Warning 1.2.4 and Lower will delete wackysDatabase folder in Plugins on Update, please backup.
        Version 1.2.4 
            Expanded Recipe Compatibility to Recipe_ ( Modification only, no cloning),  Can now change any material's type,
            category, craftingstation instead of just clones. Cannot change piecehammer of non clones. You can now set the piece's 
            material at 50% health. If you only set 1 it sets to both "full health" and "half health" otherwise,
            "material1, material2" (full, half health). "same_mat" or "no_wear" sets pieces to have no wear material.

            Fixed the piece disable/admin for custom pieces.
            Made it so you can clone stone_floor (4x4 stone prefab) - editing it probably won't make it add to Hammer
            Added special case list for objects that have multiple Gameobjects. (Bow, SpearBronze)
        Version 1.10
            All About Pieces with this Update!
            Adds ability to clone an existing CraftingStation piece and make it a new CraftingStation 
                - The CraftingStation name is "name", add recipes to it with this name.

            Added piecehammerCategory so you can change the category where piece appears on the hammer.

This mod should load last. It needs to so it can touch all other mods. 

> You can make changes to that OP bow and make it more realistic on damage or build requirements. Or even set a build piece to adminonly.

> clone the Item and change the material to make it a more appealing color.
